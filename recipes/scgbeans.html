    <h2>Description</h2>
    <div class="content2">
    <p>Blistered and charred green beans are tossed with an aromatic 
        sauce, making this Sichuan dry fried green beans dish too good 
        to pass up, and it’s substantial enough to serve as a main.</p>
    </div>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h3>Sauce</h3>
        <div class="listcontent">
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons Shaoxing wine (or dry sherry)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
    </ul>
        </div>
    <h3>Stir fry</h3>
        <div class="listcontent">
    <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 pound (450 grams) green beans, tough ends removed</li>
        <li>1/2 pound (220 grams) ground pork (optional)</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons Sichuan pickled mustard greens (Optional)</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt (or to taste)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon whole Szechuan peppercorn</li>
        <li>3 dried chilli peppers</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ginger, minced</li>
    </ul>
        </div>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <div class="listcontent">
    <ol>
        <li>Combine the sauce ingredients in a small bowl and mix well. 
            Set aside. Dry the green beans thoroughly before cooking to 
            prevent oil splatter.</li>
        <li>Heat 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in a large nonstick skillet 
            over medium high heat until hot. Add the green beans and stir 
            to coat well with oil. Spread the beans to prevent them from 
            overlapping, as much as possible. Flip every 15 seconds or so. 
            Cook and stir until the surface is mostly brown and withered, 
            10 to 15 minutes. Turn to medium heat if the pan starts to 
            smoke too much. Remove the pan from the stove. Transfer the 
            green beans to a plate and set aside.</li>
        <li>Add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil and the Sichuan peppercorns 
            to the pan. Cook over medium heat until the peppercorns turn 
            dark. Scoop out and save for later.</li>
        <li>Add the ground pork, Sichuan pickled mustard greens, and 1/4 
            teaspoon salt. Cook and chop the pork to separate it into 
            small pieces. When the surface of the pork turns golden, add 
            the dried chili pepper, garlic, and ginger. Stir a few seconds 
            to release the fragrance. Add back the green beans and pour 
            the sauce over them. Cook and stir until the sauce is mostly 
            absorbed, about 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the pan from the stove and taste a green bean. If it's 
            not salty enough, add a pinch more salt, return the pan to the 
            stove, and stir to mix well. Transfer everything to a plate.</li>
        <li>Serve hot on top of rice as a main, or as a side.</li>
